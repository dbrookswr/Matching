One solar radiation cycle is the time between a maxi- mum in the solar radiation intensity and the next maxi- mum in the solar radiation intensity. According to Figure 1, the average length of a solar radiation cycle during the past 250,000 years was: 
 less than 15,000 years. 
 between 15,000 years and 35,000 years. 
 between 35,000 years and 55,000 years. 
 greater than 55,000 years.
