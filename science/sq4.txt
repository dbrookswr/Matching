Suppose that an additional trial in Study 3 had been performed using a 12% SY medium (a diet with 12% sugar and 12% killed yeast). The average life span of the Strain X fruit flies in this trial would most likely have been: 
 less than 55.6 days. 
 between 55.6 days and 58.6 days. 
 between 58.6 days and 61.6 days. 
 greater than 61.6 days.
