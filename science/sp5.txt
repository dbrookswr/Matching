A typical acid-base indicator is a compound that will be one color over a certain lower pH range but will be a different color over a certain higher pH range. In the small range between these pH ranges—the transition range—the indicator’s color will be an intermediate of its other 2 colors. 
Students studied 5 acid-base indicators using colorless aqueous solutions of different pH and a well plate (a plate containing a matrix of round depressions—wells—that can hold small volumes of liquid). 
Experiment 1 
The students added a pH = 0 solution to 5 wells in the first column of the well plate, then added a pH = 1 solution to the 5 wells in the next column, and so on, up to pH = 7. Next, they added a drop of a given indicator (in solution) to each of the wells in a row, and then repeated this process, adding a different indicator to each row. The color of the resulting solution in each well was then recorded in Table 1 (B=blue, G=green, O=orange, P=purple, R=red, Y = yellow).

Experiment 2 
Experiment 1 was repeated with solutions that had a pH of 8 or greater (see Table 2).

Experiment 3 
Students were given 4 solutions (Solutions I?IV) of unknown pH. The well plate was used to test samples of each solution with 4 of the 5 indicators (see Table 3).
