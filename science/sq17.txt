Suppose that whenever the CH4 concentration increases, a corresponding, immediate increase in average global temperature occurs, and that whenever the CH4 concentration decreases, a corresponding, immediate decrease in average global temperature occurs. Based on Figure 2, which of the following graphs best represents a plot of average global temperature over the past 11,000 years?
