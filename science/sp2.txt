In the fall, monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) in eastern North America migrate to Mexico, where they overwinter in high-altitude forests of oyamel fir (an ever- green conifer). The butterflies store (accumulate) body lipids to use as a source of energy at a later time. Consider the following 3 hypotheses pertaining to when the butterflies store lipids and when the energy from the stored lipids is used, with respect to migration and overwintering. 
Hypothesis 1 
Monarch butterflies require energy from stored lipids for migration and during the overwintering period. The butterflies first store lipids before they begin their migra- tion. During migration, as stored lipids are converted to energy, lipid mass continuously decreases. When the butterflies reach the overwintering sites, ending their migration, they must store lipids again before beginning the overwintering period. 
Hypothesis 2 
Monarch butterflies require energy from stored lipids for migration but not during the overwintering period. The butterflies store lipids before they begin their migration. During migration, as stored lipids are converted to energy, lipid mass continuously decreases. Because energy from stored lipids is not required during the overwintering period, the butterflies do not store lipids while at the overwintering sites. 
Hypothesis 3 
Monarch butterflies require energy from stored lipids during the overwintering period but not for migration. The butterflies do not store lipids before they begin their migration. Instead, lipids are stored during migration; therefore, lipid mass continuously increases from the beginning of migration until the end of migration. The butterflies arrive at the overwintering sites with enough lipids to provide themselves with energy during the overwintering period, so they do not store lipids while at the overwintering sites.
