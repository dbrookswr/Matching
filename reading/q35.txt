The author uses the analogy of trying to grab popcorn as it pops in order to describe the trap-jaw ants’ ability to: 
 generate heat with their jaw movements. 
 move to high ground in order to attack prey. 
 attack intruders by tossing them out of the nest. 
 bounce around frantically when intruders approach.
