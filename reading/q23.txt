Bradbury’s claim “I would then take arms against the word, or for it” (line ) most strongly suggests that during his writing sessions, Bradbury would: 
 attempt to find the one word that for him was the key to understanding John Huff. 
 often reject a word as not being a catalyst for meaningful writing. 
 deliberately choose to write only about a word that inspired his fears. 
 feel as though he were struggling to find a word’s significance to him.
