Elsewhere in the essay from which Passage  is adapted, Bradbury writes: 
Was there a real boy named John Huff? 
There was. And that was truly his name. But 
he didn’t go away from me, I went away from 
him. 
How do these statements apply to both the information about Bradbury’s approach as a storyteller provided in Passage and the story of John Huff provided in Passage? 
 They reveal that Bradbury believed that to surprise readers is a fiction writer’s most important task. 
 They reinforce that Bradbury used his life experiences to create fiction but also altered those experiences as he pleased. 
 They prove that Bradbury felt such pain over leaving John that he had to reverse events to be able to write the story. 
 They indicate that Bradbury rarely used his life experiences to create fiction.
