Passage  explains that when writing about the character John Huff, Bradbury had: 
 placed John in a town in Arizona, where Bradbury himself had grown up. 
 included John in stories about a town in Arizona and in stories about Green Town. 
 “moved” John to a town other than the town in which the real-life John Huff had grown up. 
 “borrowed” John to use as a minor character in many of his stories.
