 When Bradbury claims, “Thus I fell into surprise” (line ), he’s most nearly referring to the: 
 discovery that for him the secret to a creative out- pouring was to use a word-association method to write fiction. 
 long-forgotten experiences he would remember when he would talk with his childhood friends in person. 
 realization that he wrote more effectively about his current experiences than about his past. 
 several methods other writers taught him to help him write honest, authentic stories.
