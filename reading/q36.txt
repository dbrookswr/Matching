One main purpose of the last paragraph is to suggest that unlike their bouncer-defense jump, the trap-jaw ants’ escape jump may have arisen through: 
 the ants’ trying and failing to bite intruders. 
 a change in the structure of the mandibles of several lineages of ants. 
 an accidental behavior of the ants. 
 the ants’ experiencing a positive outcome when they would attack in a large group.
