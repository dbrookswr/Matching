As described in the passage, one benefit of the trap- jaw ant’s escape jump is that it allows an ant to: 
 land in position to launch a new attack on a predator. 
 confuse a predator with a quick, sudden sting. 
 signal to other ants using a predictable movement. 
 point itself in whichever direction it chooses to escape.
