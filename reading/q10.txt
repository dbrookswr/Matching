In the last paragraph, the narrator’s father shows the narrator the photos of storefronts and piers in order to: 
 teach the narrator about the commercial progress the people who work in Bombay have made. 
 convince the narrator that Dayal and Haseler were Bombay’s first great photographers. 
 clarify his claim that his photo collection was not about modern-day Bombay but rather about the early twentieth century.
 illustrate that photos of places can reveal as much about the people who spent time there as photos of the people themselves.
