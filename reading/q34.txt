 The passage makes clear that the main source of the speed of the jaws of the trap-jaw ant is the: 
 ease of movement of the hinge of the jaw. 
 continuous, steady firing of the jaw’s mandibles. 
 light weight of the jaw in relation to the ant’s body weight. 
       release of energy stored by muscles of the jaw.
