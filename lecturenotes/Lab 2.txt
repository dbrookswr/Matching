Science or Not Science?

What is Science & What is NOT Science? 
(Not priority video content, could use paragraph of text or voice over with images; students should only spend about 5 minutes on this section)

Text:
You see information being shared among members of society; on the news, online (Facebook, Twitter, etc). Some information claims to be based on science. Other information seems to cast doubt on the legitimacy of information based on a scientific claim. So what is science? Let’s explore this question more with a real life example. (Click the link/play the video below)

What is Science? An organized way to approach understanding a natural phenomena
	•	Dynamic (iterative) process
	•	Repeatable
	•	Objective not subjective (will need to define these terms)
When examining aspects of science, you could be discussing content, process, or attitude.
	•	Content: facts, concepts and generalizations that have been collected through the process of science
	•	Process: in lab you will be working your way through the scientific method which will allow you to begin the process of collecting content-based information.
	•	Attitude: During lab, we will seek to develop a healthy scientific view of the world. This approach means examining a question thoughtfully, logically, and without judgment. Answering the question will often require us to be patient, persistent, and open-minded. 


 
WINDY WONDERS!!
How can I tell the difference between scientific and non-scientific news articles?

Aspects of Science & the Scientific Method

Three Aspects of Science
Click the link below to watch a brief video that will help you develop an understanding of some aspects of science.

Text: 
Let’s review three important aspects of science: content, process, and attitude.
	•	Content refers to the facts that have been gathered and the theories that have been supported over the past few hundred years. 
	•	Process refers to how scientists go about conducting science. When we discuss the steps in the scientific method, we are listing some basic process skills.
	•	Attitude refers to how we approach science. When performing or evaluating science, you should approach this task with open-mindedness, persistence, logic, and a problem-solving approach. Anyone attempting to do science must set aside their personal bias and approach their experiments with honesty and integrity.


ELAINE SUPERBRAIN’S TASKS
Provide an example of a poor scientific attitude. Why would this type of attitude not be considered a scientific attitude?

Answer: Remember a scientific attitude must be open-minded, persistent, logical, and honest.


The Scientific Method
(This is priority video content; Jen & Christy Lightboard)
The scientific method is a series of steps:
	•	Observation: Notice or sense a natural phenomenon (see, smell, hear etc.)
	•	Ask a question(s) about the natural phenomenon
	•	Research: see if someone else has already answered the question scientifically
	•	Construct a hypothesis (es): must be written so that it is falsifiable and testable
	•	Design an experiment to test the hypothesis
	•	Independent variable: what you will manipulate (change/test)
	•	Dependent variable: what you will measure
	•	Control: the baseline for your comparison in the experiment 
	•	Make predictions of outcomes of your experiment, depending on whether your hypothesis is supported or rejected
	•	Conduct experiment(s)
	•	Analyze experimental results
	•	Support or reject hypothesis
	•	Report analysis of results: summarize conclusions

ELAINE SUPERBRAIN’S TASKS
You’ll be using the scientific method to design an experiment in lab this week. Let’s practice by designing an experiment to test different methods for preserving cut flowers.

Directions: Read the article linked below. Based on the information provided in the article, how could you design an experiment to test whether or not a selected treatment option was effective at keeping cut flowers fresh?
https://www.livescience.com/38901-keep-cut-flowers-fresh.html
(if worried link will go bad, could do pdf version)

For this assignment, you will attach your one-page experimental design document in Canvas for review by your lab instructor. If needed, you can consult your lecture textbook and/or your laboratory textbook to solidify your understanding of the terms independent variable, dependent variable, control, and hypothesis. 
**Natisha: If you have ideas on how to build this assignment: please let us know.

Be sure to include the following information in your one-page uploaded document:
	•	Generate a hypothesis. What treatment option do you think would best preserve cut flowers? Why? 
“I hypothesize that ____________ would result in cut flowers being kept fresh because ____________.
	•	State the independent variables: what types of treatments are you going to test?
	•	State the dependent variables: how will you accurately measure whether or not your treatment successfully kept the cut flowers fresh?
	•	What type of control do you need to include in your experimental design to demonstrate whether or not your treatment was effective?
	•	How many cut flower samples should you test to be confident in your results and why?
	•	Based on your experimental set-up, what results would support your hypothesis? What results would falsify your hypothesis?

Lab 2 - Scientific Method

HARRY’S TIP OF THE DAY
Practice at least twice a week rather than cramming before the exam! Research shows you won’t learn much by cramming.

WHAT SHOULD I EXPECT FOR THIS LAB?
In class lab activities will include:
	•	Designing an experiment using a model organism
	•	Performing your experiment
	•	Evaluating and refining your experimental design
	•	Performing your refined experiment
	•	Recording your data and summarizing your experimental results
HOW SHOULD I PREPARE FOR THIS LAB?
Remember to:
	•	Read your lab manual and bring your manual to lab.
	•	Make sure to wear closed-toed shoes to lab.
	•	Perform some basic online research to get to know the model organism you will be using in your experiment in the lab.

       

Congratulations! You’ve completed the online work for Lab 2.
