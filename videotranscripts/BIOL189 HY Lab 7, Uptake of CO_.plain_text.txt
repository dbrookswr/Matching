Lab 7, uptake of carbon dioxide. In lab, we will be examining the uptake of carbon dioxide from the environment by a plant specimen. You will need to properly set up the experiment in order to collect useful data. When performing your experiments, it is important you wear gloves. We need to protect our hands from the materials that we are using in our experiments. 

Before you perform any experiment, you shouldn't mentally review the following. One, what is being manipulated in the experiment? What is the independent variable? Two, what type of outcome is being measured? What is the dependent variable? And how are you actually measuring the outcome? Is it qualitative, like a color change, or quantitative measure, like something measured with grams or millimeters? 

Number three, are there controls? And if so, what are they? And number four, what types of predictions of outcomes can you make before actually conducting the experiment? Placing a lodia plant into a test tube. Cover the plant with water. Add four to five drops of phenol red to the test tube. Gently flick the test tube to mix. Observe the color of the solution. 

Insert a straw into the test tube. Gently blow through the straw into the solution in the test tube. By performing this task, you are providing a source of carbon dioxide to the environment. Observe the color of the solution now. Immediately stopper the test tube. Place this test tube in a well-lit area for 10 to 20 minutes undisturbed. Record your observations of the test tube following this incubation period and proceed to data analysis.
