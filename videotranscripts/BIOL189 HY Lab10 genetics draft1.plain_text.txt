Lab 10, Population Genetics. Determining allele frequencies over generations. In lab, we will be determining allele frequency over generations using a mock system to generate data. Before you perform any experiment, you should mentally review the following. 

One, what is being manipulated in the experiment? What is the independent variable? Two, what type of outcome is being measured? What is the dependent variable, and how are you actually measuring the outcome? Is it qualitative, like a color change, or a quantitative measure, like something measured with grams or millimeters? Number three, are there controls? And if so, what are they? And number four, what types of predictions of outcomes can you make before actually conducting the experiment? 

Your lab instructor will provide you with a beaker that contains 50 red plastic pieces and 50 white plastic pieces. The red piece represents the capital R allele while the white piece represents the lower case r allele. One member of your group will gently shake the beaker, and without looking, remove two of these plastic pieces. 

The other group member will record the color identity of the two plastic pieces. The group member with the beaker will replace the two plastic pieces, shake the beaker again, and then remove two plastic pieces. Again, the other group member will record the color identity of the two pulled plastic pieces. As a group, you will perform this task 50 times to generate data for this experiment. Once you have completed the data collection, you can begin the data analysis aspect of this experiment.
