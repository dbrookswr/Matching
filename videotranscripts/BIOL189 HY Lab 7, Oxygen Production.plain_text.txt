Lab 7, Oxygen Production. In lab, we will be examining the production of oxygen by a water-based plant specimen. You will need to properly set up the experiment in order to collect useful data. When performing your experiment, you need to wear gloves. We wear gloves to protect our hands when working with materials in our experiments. 

Before you perform any experiment, you shouldn't mentally review the following. One, what is being manipulated in the experiment? What is the independent variable? Two, what type of outcome is being measured? What is the dependent variable? And how are you actually measuring the outcome? Is it qualitative, like a color change, or a quantitative measure, like something major with grams or millimeters? Number three, are there controls? And if so, what are they? And number four, what types of predictions of outcomes can you make before actually conducting the experiment? 

First, transfer 350 milliliters of water into a 500 milliliter beaker. Place the elodea plant into the mouth of a glass funnel. Place the glass funnel containing the elodea plant into the 500 milliliter beaker, with the mouth of the funnel facing down. 

The stem of the funnel should also be underwater. If it is not, add additional water. Completely fill a test tube with water. Place your thumb over the open end of the test tube. Invert the test tube. Carefully but quickly transfer the end of the inverted test tube over the stem of the funnel. 

Now that you've completed that task, carefully place this setup under the light setup provided by the lab instructor. Observe the oxygen bubbles produced during this time, and the displacement of water in the test tube by the oxygen produced during the light reactions of photosynthesis. Your instructor may provide modifications on how to conclude this experiment during your lab class.
