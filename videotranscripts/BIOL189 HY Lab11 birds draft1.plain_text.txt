Lab 11. Natural selection for bird beak shapes. In lab we will be performing a series of mock natural selection experiments. Before you perform any experiment, you should mentally review the following. One, what is being manipulated in the experiment? What is the independent variable? Two, what type of outcome is being measured? What is the dependent variable? And how are you actually measuring the outcome? Is it qualitative, like a color change, or quantitative measure, like something major with grams or millimeters? 

Number three, are there controls? And if so, what are they? And number four, what types of predictions of outcomes can you make before actually conducting the experiment? 

In groups, you will form a series of mock natural selection experiments where common utensils such as scissors, tweezers, spoons, and binder clips will represent Finch bird beaks. Each member of your group will be assigned a different utensil or bird beak. Paper cups will represent your bird stomachs. The purpose of this experiment is to determine which bird beak is most successful with regard to different types of food and food obtainment. Different types of food resources will be provided for each round of your experiment. 

As a group of birds, you will have 20 seconds to pick up as much of the food source as you can and transfer it, using your beak, to your cup stomach. After 20 seconds, you will record the amount of food that you were able to secure. This activity will be repeated with the different food types with the data being collected each round. Once the data has been collected, you can then proceed to the data analysis component of this experiment.
