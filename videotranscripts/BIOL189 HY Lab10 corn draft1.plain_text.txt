Lab 10, the Corn Maze, Corn Inheritance. In lab, we will be determining the phenotypic frequency of an ear of Indian corn. Before you perform any experiment, you should mentally review the following. One, what is being manipulated in the experiment? What is the independent variable? two, what type of outcome is being measured? 

What is the dependent variable? And how are you actually measuring the outcome? Is it qualitative, like a color change, or a quantitative measure, like something major with grams or millimeters? Number three, are there controls, and if so, what are they? And number four, what types of predictions of outcomes can you make before actually conducting the experiment? 

Obtain an ear of Indian corn from your instructor. Do not remove the plastic surrounding the corn. We have the plastic on the corn to maintain the integrity of the corn and prevent the loss of corn kernels. Using the paperclip provided, one group member will be responsible for counting the corn kernels representing each phenotype-- purple smooth, purple wrinkled, yellow smooth, and yellow wrinkled, for two complete rows on the corn cob. Do not count more than two rows on the corn cob. The other group member will record the phenotypic counts. Once the data is collected, proceed to the data analysis component of this experiment.
