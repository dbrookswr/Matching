Lab 6-- Hypotonicity and Hypertonicity in Animal Cells. In lab, we will be examining osmosis using whole sheep blood and various environmental conditions. You will need to properly set up the experiment in order to collect useful data. When performing chemical tests, it is important that you wear your gloves to protect your hands from the materials you are using in these tests. 

Before you perform any experiment, you should mentally review the following. 1, what is being manipulated in the experiment? What is the independent variable? 2, what type of outcome is being measured? What is the dependent variable? And how are you actually measuring the outcome? Is it qualitative, like a color change? Or quantitative measure, like something major with grams or millimeters? 

Number 3, are there controls? And if so, what are they? And number 4, what types of predictions of outcomes can you make before actually conducting the experiment? 

Obtain three slides and three cover slips. You will label the slides before beginning the experiment. Using a wax pencil, label slide 1 on the top right corner with a 0.9%. Label slide 2 with a 10%. And label slide 3 with a 0%. 

Obtain three test tubes. Using a Sharpie marker, label test tube 1 with 0.9%. Label test tube 2 with 10%. And label test tube 3 with a 0%. 

Using a plastic pipette, transfer 5 milliliters of each designated solution into its corresponding test tube. Obtain a sample of whole sheep blood. At 5 drops of whole sheep blood to each test tube. And then flick the bottom of the test tubes to mix. Then allow the test tubes to remain undisturbed on the lab bench for one minute. 

Following that minute incubation, compare and contrast the clearness of the different solutions to one another. And then record your results. 

Following this, prepare wet mounts using these solutions. Observe each slide using your microscope. Record your observations using the 40x objective, 400x magnification. Proceed to data analysis.
