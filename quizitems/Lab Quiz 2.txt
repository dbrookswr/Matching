1. Identify a flaw in the following hypothesis: (1 point)
	If dolphins could talk, then they would tell us they are disappointed about the state of the oceans.






2. The following graph represents a student’s typing speed measured after each week of practice.  What are the independent and the dependent variables? (2 points)
  

3. You have the hypothesis that if a plant receives fertilizer, then it will grow larger. Outline an experiment to test this hypothesis. (2 points)







4. Underline the flaw in the experimental design outlined in quotes below, then explain why it is flawed. (1 point)
“I am planning to conduct an experiment with laboratory mice where I test the effects of different food types on the weight loss/gain of the mice. I will use three mice per trial: one will be fed a control diet that will result in no weight change, one will be fed a high fat diet, and the last will be fed a high protein diet. The control diet mouse will be provided with an exercise wheel. You can see how the mice are housed in individual cages below.”














5. Identify the independent variable in the mouse experiment described above. (1 point)
 

6. The graph to the right shows the body temperature profile of a ground squirrel that has (a) briefly emerged from hibernation, (b) reached its normal active body temperature, then (c) re-entered hibernation.

a. What is the dependent variable in this graph? (1 point)   
b. What is the independent variable in this graph? (1 point)

 
	
   7. Underline the flaw in the hypothesis in quotes below, then explain why it is flawed.
