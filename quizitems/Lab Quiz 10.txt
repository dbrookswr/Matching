Lab 10 Quiz: Genetics (10 points)
Performance objectives:
	•	Describe how the following terms are related: chromosome, gene, allele, homozygous, heterozygous, genotype, phenotype, dominant trait, and recessive trait.
	•	Discuss expected results and observed results based on the inheritance of one trait.
	•	Describe the inheritance of some common genetic traits in humans.
	•	Discuss basic principles of population genetics and the Hard-Weinberg model.
	•	Construct a simple pedigree, monohybrid, and dihybrid Punnett squares.
	•	Generate predictions about results regarding collection of in-class genetic trait data.

	•	How would you represent an organism that is heterozygous for an “A” gene and recessive homozygous for a “B” gene? Draw your answer. (1.5 points)
 



	•	What is the law of independent assortment? (1 point)




	•	Describe genetic equilibrium and how it relates to alleles. (1 point)






	•	If the frequency of two alleles in a gene pool is 80% A and 20%a, what is the frequency of individuals in the population with genotype Aa? (1 point)





	•	A female monster is heterozygous for both tail color and tail shape; she has a purple tail that is curly (PpCc). The male monster has an orange tail that is straight (ppcc)/ What is the probability that the offspring will have a curly orange tail? (1.5 points) (0.5 points for correct gametes, 0.5 points for completed table, 0.5 points for correct probability)



Practical Questions:
	•	Identify the blood type given the results of the blood typing test at the side bench.



	•	Using the image projected on the screen, what is the genotype of the highlighted individual?


	•	 The displayed corn from the lab last week demonstrated what phenotypic ratio?


	•	Is the genetic trait displayed a dominant or recessive trait?
